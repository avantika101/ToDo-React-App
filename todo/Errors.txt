dispatch is not a function etc
sol: 
import Context with {} since it is not the default app! :facepalm

cannot update a component while rendering a different component 
sol:
If you are using functional components you could wrap the setState call into useEffect

tried this in ToDoItem
const [dispatch, setDispatch] = useState('');
useEffect(() => {
    setDispatch(useContext(Context));
},[])
cannot call a hook inside a hook
hooks must be called inside a function component or a custom hook function

My educated guess is that React doesn't like the fact that the state of the parent component is being updated 
by functions passed to the children, which again are dependant on the props passed along with it. Am I on to something?

<button onClick={dispatch({type: 'delete', payload: id})}>Delete</button> 
change to
<button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'delete', payload: id})}>Delete</button> 

what the hell
